    fixes

1. adding the correct event, there is some issue
2. update the user data in family json, when the name of the person changes

Questions for Yeabsira
1. should there be an event type when editing an event 
2. should there be a gender....because i couldn't find it in the backend json data
3.



Questions to Ask Yeabsira
    - how do you want to handle the icons/flags
        1. are they going to become from the backend
        2. or should we create a an icon for each flag....italy -> (https://localhost:8080)
        3. Top Sort the data of family Tree


Tasks Done
1. was able to display a data for only one Node
2. Family Tree using topological sort...it works as it should be displayed....meaning after sending it the data received from the backend....it will structure from top to down....from grandparent to the grandchildren
3. 


Remaining Tasks
1. Figure out how he displayed the parent/children relationship using the nodes 
2. Figure out how to display the connected nodes....he used just static ways to display
3. figure out how each node each node accepts from the return type of the topological sort function

1. Make the node-store to persist the data to localstorage and access it from there
2. use your trial task approach to add people to the family Tree
